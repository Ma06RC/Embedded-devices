avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as E1
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as 99

this gives internal osc set to 1mhz
blink test shows 1000ms == 1sec, so good


serial not working with previous UBBR value, recalculating.

want 9600 
UBBR = fosc/16*baud -1

1000000/(16*9600) -1 = 5.5 rounding to 6 should be okay.
no luck. redoing serial from 


sample code from binaryupdates.com worked nicely
